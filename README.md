# FontWrangler for iPadOS 1.0.0 #

FontWrangler provides a means to install OpenType (`.otf`) and TrueType (`.ttf`) files on an iPad. It requires iPadOS 13.0 or above.

## Usage ##

Copy fonts you for which you have legitimate usage rights to FontWrangler’s Documents folder on your iPad. To do so, connect your iPad to your computer using Finder (macOS Catalina or above) or iTunes (macOS Mojave or under), then transfer font files using the **Apps** tab.

When you run FontWrangler, it will process your fonts, removing them from the Documents folder as it does so.

Select a font in FontWrangler’s list to view a preview; you can adjust the slider to increase or decrease the preview point size.

Tap **Install** to make the fonts available to other iPad apps that are able to do so.

Please note that not all apps will be able to access app-installed fonts.

Installed apps are marked as such in FontWrangler and listed in iPadOS’ **Settings > General > Fonts**. Here you can remove installed fonts. This makes them no longer accessible to compatible apps, but does not delete them from FontWrangler, so you can re-install them in future.

To remove a font from FontWrangler, tap **Edit** and delete the font from the list. If the font you are deleting is currently installed (ie. listed in iPadOS’ **Settings > General > Fonts**), it will be uninstalled before it is deleted. Deleted fonts cannot be reinstalled without first being copied to your iPad as outlined above.

If you delete FontWrangler from your iPad, you will also uninstall and delete any fonts it contains.
